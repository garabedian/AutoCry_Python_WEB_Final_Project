# AutoCry_Python_WEB_Final_Project
This is my Pyhon Web Framework Final Project
which is a simple items register (in my case - cars). 
It is my last course from SoftUni-Bulgaria program "Python Web Developer",
which I started on 06.April.2019 as an "Open" course.
Additionally I have completed with excellent scores the "Ethical Hacking Basics" course and 
the "C++" module, consisting of "Basics", "Fundamentals" and "Advanced" courses.
