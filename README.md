# AutoCry_Python_WEB_Final_Project
This is my Pyhon Web Framework Final Project which is a simple items register (in my case - cars). 
It is written in Django/Python, using Bootstrap and fontawesome.
Uploaded images are previewed for better UX, which is achieved by JavaScript.
It is my last course from SoftUni-Bulgaria Software Engineering Educational Program "Python Web Developer",
which I started on 06.April.2019 as an "Open" course.
Courses included: "Basics", 2x"Fundamentals", "Advanced", "OOP", 2x"Web Frameworks".
Additionally I have completed with excellent scores the "Ethical Hacking Basics" course, 
the "C++" module, consisting of "Basics", "Fundamentals" and "Advanced" courses, and 
the "Javascript" module, consisting of "Basics", "Advanced" and "Applications" courses.
