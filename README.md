# AutoCry_Python_WEB_Final_Project
This is my Python Web Framework Final Project which is a simple items register (in my case - cars). 
- Here users can: 
- register, login, and edit their profiles; 
- add, edit and delete their favourite vehicles; 
- see other members stuff, like or dislike others uploads;
- It is written in Django/Python. 
- Javascript and Bootstrap are also used for better UX (i.e. styling of elements and previewing of uploaded images).
- Further information about certain features could be found in Documentation.docx

- It is my last course from SoftUni-Bulgaria Software Engineering Educational Program "Python Web Developer",
which I started on 06.April.2019 as an "Open" course.
Courses included: "Basics", 2x"Fundamentals", "Advanced", "OOP", 2x"Web Frameworks".
Additionally I have completed with excellent scores the "Ethical Hacking Basics" course, 
the "C++" module, consisting of "Basics", "Fundamentals" and "Advanced" courses, and 
the "Javascript" module, consisting of "Basics", "Advanced" and "Applications" courses.
